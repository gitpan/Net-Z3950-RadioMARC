Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::RadioMARC.

0.03  Wed Dec  1 17:39:46 GMT 2004
	- New "identityField" property may be set to indicate a field
	  whose contents identify a record for purposes of comparison
	  to see whether an expected record is in a result set.
	- Better test-suite, including a rigorous work-out for the
	  utility IndexMARC module.
	- Many small corrections and clarifications in documentation.

0.02  Tue Nov 23 17:40:22 GMT 2004
	- First released version.

0.01  Sat Nov 20 00:04:43 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X Net::Z3950::RadioMARC


### Still to do:
	- Meaningful tests for the RadioMarc module itself
	- Honour the "delay" property
	- Recognise "non-diagnostic failures" such as timeouts
	- Skip tests against servers that are not even there
	- Have IndexMARC.pm parse PQF properly and handle booleans
	- Maybe have IndexMARC.pm parse fields more cleverly
	- Link to an overview paper describing the approach
