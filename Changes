### Still to do:
	- Meaningful tests
	- Honour the "delay" property
	- Recognise "non-diagnostic failures" such as timeouts
	- Skip tests against servers that are not even there
	- Have IndexMARC.pm parse PQF properly and handle booleans
	- Maybe have IndexMARC.pm parse fields more cleverly
	- Link to an overview paper describing the approach
