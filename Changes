Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::RadioMARC.

0.04  Fri Dec 17 11:41:26 GMT 2004
	- Include a real sample radioactive MARC record.
	- Better example scripts that run against The Z-Interop server
	  at research.lis.unt.edu:2200/zinterop
	- Allow the "identifyField" property to identify a control
	  field (without subfield) as well as a subfield of a normal
	  field.
	- Honour the "delay" property.
	- Tokenisation rules in IndexMARC.pm changed so that ",", ".",
	  ":" and "/" are now all word-separators.
	- The distribution now includes an "examples" directory that
	  contains example scripts (and the records they need to check
	  against).
	- test() now returns just the status when called in scalar
	  context.
	- When a test succeeds, if no message is defined for the "ok"
	  status then there is no output at all.  Previously, the
	  output was "status='ok'" which made made it impossible to
	  write silent-if-successful test scripts.

0.03  Wed Dec  1 17:39:46 GMT 2004
	- New "identityField" property may be set to indicate a field
	  whose contents identify a record for purposes of comparison
	  to see whether an expected record is in a result set.
	- Better test-suite, including a rigorous work-out for the
	  utility IndexMARC module.
	- Many small corrections and clarifications in documentation.

0.02  Tue Nov 23 17:40:22 GMT 2004
	- First released version.

0.01  Sat Nov 20 00:04:43 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X Net::Z3950::RadioMARC


### Still to do:
	- Meaningful tests for the RadioMarc module itself
	- Recognise "non-diagnostic failures" such as timeouts
	- Skip tests against servers that are not even there
	- Have IndexMARC.pm parse PQF properly and handle booleans
	- Maybe have IndexMARC.pm parse fields more cleverly
	- Link to an overview paper describing the approach
