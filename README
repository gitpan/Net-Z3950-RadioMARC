Net::Z3950::RadioMARC
=====================

This module provides a simple way to write test-harnesses for the
University of North Texas's "radioactive MARC record" project.  This
approach tests Z39.50 servers and explores their indexing strategies
by injecting a "radioactive" MARC record whose fields contain known
values unlikely to occur naturally in the wild, and searching for
them.


Playing with the Module
-----------------------

In the root directory of the distribution (i.e. the directory that
contains this README file), run the simple example script as follows.
(Once you've installed, as described below, you can omit "-I lib".)

	perl -I lib etc/simple.pl
	perl -I lib etc/objective.pl

Take a look at these scripts.  They shows you the two styles in which
the module can be used.  They're pretty self-explanatory, and probably
provide a better introduction than the actual documentation does.


Installation
------------

To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
