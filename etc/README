"simple.pl" is a very simple radioactive-MARC test script,
demonstrating some of the capabilities of the RadioMARC module.

"sample.marc" is a file containing a single MARC records, obtained by
searching for "mineral" at indexdata.com:210/gils, and downloading the

test-scripts against the Index Data public server.
